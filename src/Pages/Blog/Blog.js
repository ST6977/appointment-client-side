      <h4>PickTime Always gives you the Best Servics</h4>

      <p>
        Picktime is the best choice for hospitals and doctors as it is quite
        transparent from both ends. No manipulation can be done internally, as
        well as the people booking an appointment get a very wide range of
        options to select for. They get to know when the doctor is available,
        which slots are already booked, how much time each checkup usually
        takes, the charges of each checkup/treatment, and many more. By opting
        for Picktime software for your hospital to schedule appointments,
        patients/clients get the following features from your side:
        <br />
        <br />
        1.Patients get to know what are the slots in which the desired doctor is
        available.
        <br />
        2.They can look at the charges of each service and the charges of
        different doctors under the same roof.
        <br />
        3.They can book the slot from a desktop/laptop as well as from mobiles.
        <br />
        4.The ‘book now’ feature is available 24/7.
        <br />
        5.Doctors or hospitals can collect copay or full payments while
        customers books an appointment.
